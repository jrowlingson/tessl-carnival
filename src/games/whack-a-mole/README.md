# Whack-a-Mole

Whack the moles as they pop up from the nine holes, before they duck back down.

## How to play

- Moles pop up one at a time from a 3 by 3 grid of holes, stay up for a moment,
  then drop back down.
- Click a mole while it's up to whack it.
- As the round goes on, moles pop up more often and stay up for less time: a new
  mole every 1.1 seconds at the start, down to every 0.4 seconds at the end, and
  each one stays up for 1.4 seconds at the start, down to 0.6 seconds.
- A round lasts 30 seconds. Click again on the game over screen to play another round.

## Scoring

Each mole you whack scores 10 points. Clicking an empty hole costs nothing.

Your final score is saved to the carnival's score board when the round ends.

## Files

- `game.ts`: the game logic (`createState`, `step`, `popUp`, `whack`, `spawnGap`,
  `upTime`) and the `whackAMole` entry, the default export the midway finds.
- `game.test.ts`: tests for the game logic.
